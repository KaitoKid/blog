            <h1 id="The-Peak-of-Fremont"><a href="#The-Peak-of-Fremont" class="headerlink" title="The Peak of Fremont"></a>The Peak of Fremont</h1><p>Well, I can officially say that I’m back to bouldering again. I registered with Jinni, another fellow Workday intern (and I finally realized that Workday is spelled without a capital <em>D</em>) cus it was the closest location, and it has a summer $150 special for 3 months. This will last us all the way until the end of our internships. Additionally, we may be getting $50/mo from Workday for gym memberships and other health related materials/activities so hopefully that pulls through.</p>
<p>My arms are sore. Like stupidly sore. I haven’t seriously exercised since the last Under Armour x Cal event where Chelsey and I did a HIIT class. I couldn’t even make it half the way and I was sore for days afterwards. I’m not looking forward to waking up tomorrow - I can barely even like squeeze out my toothpaste LOL. Stretching my forearms as much as I can.</p>
<p>Rhea was our driver today, and she did it out the generosity of her heart. She was originally going to climb but then chose not to, so she shopped around nearby and took us home. <em>What. A. Mom.</em> Not only that, but Rhea was also the roommate of Revati last year. What are the chances that we’d be connected through Jinni <strong>and</strong> Revati. Small world. Hopefully she’ll be able to join in next time! I’m planning to go climbing at least 2 times a week, possibly three times if the stars align. Otherwise I’ll probably show up to work early, hit the gym after, and take a Scoop home.</p>
<h1 id="InkBox"><a href="#InkBox" class="headerlink" title="InkBox"></a>InkBox</h1><p>Surprisingly, InkBox pulled through, as in, it works a lot better than I thought it would. I’ll attach a photo here eventually but for now, I can’t figure out how to get images to work properly on Hexo. I placed it on my wrist, and it got noticed today <em>woohoo</em>. </p>
<p>This wasn’t super clean, so I’m hoping my next attempt will be better. I haven’t decided where I’d put the next yet because it’s quite big and not as subtle. (The ouroboros one)</p>
<p><img src="https://kairuizeng.com/blog/images/inkbox-tattoo.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="Boujie-Apartment"><a href="#Boujie-Apartment" class="headerlink" title="Boujie Apartment"></a>Boujie Apartment</h1><p>I nearly forgot, but damn this apartment is boujie. Once again, I promise I’ll stick in photos as soon as I figure it out. I’m planning to host a party with OCTO and other friends here.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: Here we go!</p>
<p><img src="https://kairuizeng.com/blog/images/apt1.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="https://kairuizeng.com/blog/images/apt2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="GAMING"><a href="#GAMING" class="headerlink" title="GAMING"></a>GAMING</h1><p>YES. I GOT MY ETHERNET IN THE MAIL TODAY. It’s wired up super ratchet but you know what, it works. I got in my first games of Fortnite in ages. Well, I say games but I actually played with my old friends Merumi, etc. (from my Soccer Spirits days, but that’s a story for another time) for almost 5 hours. </p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Didn’t mean for that to happen (and I had to eat canned soup with rice AGAIN for dinner) but I’m glad it did, had so much fun which I’ve been missing out on. We still gotta fix the wifi issue though cus poor Gayashan doesn’t get any signal in his room.</p>
<h1 id="Work-Work-Work"><a href="#Work-Work-Work" class="headerlink" title="Work Work Work"></a>Work Work Work</h1><p>Yea, I got a lot of work to catch up on. I feel like my anxiety and my insomnia really do stem from falling behind on work and not being able to catch up. I really intend to get in a good amount of work done tomorrow, and hopefully I’ll be able to follow up with these priorities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Homework for my CogSci class</li>
<li>DeepScribe</li>
<li>Workday (XpressO lessons)</li>
</ol>
<p>Worst part is, it’s the Warriors vs Rockets game 7 tomorrow which I HAVE to watch. I told Gayashan I’d hit up a bar with him in Oakland or Berkeley but I don’t think I’ll be able to follow through with that - but to be fair, I don’t think he’ll mind. He isn’t exactly a fan of either team anyways. However, whichever team wins will basically win the conference finals.</p>
<p>The Cavs put up one hell of a fight, and so did the Celtics, but they’ll both fall to the West. Just watch.</p>
<h1 id="Closing"><a href="#Closing" class="headerlink" title="Closing"></a>Closing</h1><p>In closing, I just have a few other things on my mind. I’m pretty sure nobody reads this so I don’t really care - so I was told some tips from my doctor on how to desensitize myself, so hopefully that works out. Also, there’s still so much I need to do this week, I really need some time off where I take a whole day to myself where I’m not trying to meet people, impress people, and so that I can just be the potato I am. </p>
<p>Signing out (:  </p>

            <h1 id="GAME-SEVEN"><a href="#GAME-SEVEN" class="headerlink" title="GAME SEVEN"></a>GAME SEVEN</h1><p>Annnnnd here we go. This is definitely the real finals of this NBA season, whatever happens next can’t even come close to the Warriors vs Rockets. No matter if Celtics take the East or the Cavs, they won’t stand a chance against the West. Since it does fall on Memorial Day, I’m hoping to head out to a local bar around Oakland or Berkeley, to really get that playoffs vibe. I’m pretty sure wherever we go around Pleasanton, it’s not going to be as lit as up in the East Bay.</p>
<h1 id="Other-News"><a href="#Other-News" class="headerlink" title="Other News"></a>Other News</h1><p>I don’t really have much other news. I went home this weekend so I could clean out my apartment in Berkeley in preparation for my subletters this summer, I can’t believe that I have two different people subletting. The first pair is a couple and they’re bringing their own beds, so I had to deconstruct mine and move it out into the living room. Thank’s Denny for letting me use your space. The landlord is gunna replace our fire alarms so they don’t go off in a chain reaction anymore, and removing the old couch that nobody uses. </p>
<p>I brought my Alesis V25 back to Pleasanton so hopefully I can make that work out. In terms of better news, I did just pick up a new skateboard! I’ve always wanted to skateboard so I thought now is as good of a time as any. </p>
<h1 id="Welcome-Gin"><a href="#Welcome-Gin" class="headerlink" title="Welcome Gin"></a>Welcome Gin</h1><p><img src="https://kairuizeng.com/blog/images/gin.jpg" alt="Gin"></p>
<p>I named her <em>Gin</em> because it kinda sounds cool like a name from Gintama or Detective Conan… also because it’s called <code>Gin and Tonic</code> by Landyachtz. Apparently the Dinghy is supposed to be fantastic for commuting. I’m deathly scared of getting injured so I did pick up a helmet, elbow and knee pads, and a wrist brace. Go me! I also just decided on the spot that she’s a female. </p>
<h1 id="Tattoos-Galore"><a href="#Tattoos-Galore" class="headerlink" title="Tattoos Galore"></a>Tattoos Galore</h1><p>Ok, I also did just get some InkBox tattoos in the mail. As soon as I finish writing this post, I’m gunna go put them on. They seem absolutely ridiculously cool, I feel like I’m getting my rebellious phase 10 years late LOL. I picked two geeky ones, one is the hearts from Zelda, and another is the Ouroboros tattoo from Full Metal Alchemist.</p>
<h1 id="Tired"><a href="#Tired" class="headerlink" title="Tired"></a>Tired</h1><p>Oh yea, not sure why but I’ve been feeling suuuuuper tired again lately, like no matter how much I sleep, I’m still tired. It really is affecting my ability to focus as well as my balance or something. It’s really trippy but it’s basically like how I felt in the past. Maybe it comes in waves periodically? Like the vestibular migraines the doctor talked about? Anyways, it’s really shitty (oh yea, it could be insomnia too, hopefully working out helps) so I’m praying for the best.</p>
<h1 id="Bouldering"><a href="#Bouldering" class="headerlink" title="Bouldering"></a>Bouldering</h1><p>Can’t wait to start going to the gym again! I’m making this summer the most transformative yet for me. Tomorrow I’m hitting up the bouldering gym for the first time in three years with Jinni and her roommate, other interns at Workday. My excuses in the past were that I couldn’t find my shoes, or that I can’t figure out how to get to the climbing gym. Well, now I don’t have either but I also am genuinely interested in climbing again.</p>
<p>Can’t think of much else to say, so I’m calling it for this post. Shoot, gotta do my homework for my online classes too ugh.</p>

            <h1 id="Streak-Broken"><a href="#Streak-Broken" class="headerlink" title="Streak Broken"></a>Streak Broken</h1><p>I can’t believe I broke the streak already. To be honest, I was literally thinking about blogging yesterday before I even left work, but by the time I got home, I just got so depressed by the Warriors loss to the Rockets that I went straight to sleep.</p>
<p>During day 2 of orientation, we learned more about the intern roadmap, meeting up with our managers, and what to expect from this internship. Throughout the introductions, there were definitely quite a few <code>go bears</code> thrown in here and there. I think almost 1/10th of the entire intern workforce is from Berkeley. </p>
<p>I also swapped out my Macbook Air for a Macbook Pro, but it was quite a painful process because I had to leave orientation. My first trip I accidentally took Noah’s backpack, and by the time I made it back, the activity was over. Oops.</p>
<h1 id="Day-Three"><a href="#Day-Three" class="headerlink" title="Day Three"></a>Day Three</h1><p>Today was an interesting day. I had to miss out on the XpressO (WorkDay’s proprietary language) training since I had to go grab my passport from back home in Berkeley. Along the way I got my rash checked out, and turns out I have a jock itch/ringworm. The cream for this literally burns like hell oh my god I hate it so much. I didn’t bring my WorkDay backpack with me, so after getting my I-9/employment eligibility worked out, I just went straight home - doing the bootcamp remotely.</p>
<p>Unforunately for Gayashan, his team got absolutely destroyed in the finals for the East in the Stanley Cup. Poor guy, since apparently Tampa had the number one offense in the league - until game 5. They haven’t been able to score a single point since then. He followed up with making deviled eggs for his team’s picnic tomorrow. I’m actually really surprised by how easy it is to make, as well as how well he can cook. Hopefully I can pick up a few things from him this summer. He’s honestly such a cool guy even though we have a 7 year difference between us. I really do feel like I lucked out, can’t wait to spend the rest of these 11 weeks with him.</p>
<h1 id="Gym-Situation"><a href="#Gym-Situation" class="headerlink" title="Gym Situation"></a>Gym Situation</h1><p>Ok now this is a real problem. WorkDay has a gym for $25 per month that I intend to go to, but I also really do want to pick up climbing again. Jinni expressed that she wants to go (and she’s hoping to coerce her roommate into climbing so we can get a ride to The Peak in Fremont!) I’m really hoping my jock itch clears up somewhat by then… otherwise it’ll be quite a painful experience.</p>
<h1 id="Closing"><a href="#Closing" class="headerlink" title="Closing"></a>Closing</h1><p>Well, that’s it for today. I still need to get a power brick from Samsung, get an ethernet cable for my PC, fix the wifi issue so Gayashan can use wifi in his room, setup a dentist and vision appointment… oh man there’s a lot. <em>Signing out</em></p>

            <h1 id="And-I’m-Back"><a href="#And-I’m-Back" class="headerlink" title="And I’m Back"></a>And I’m Back</h1><p>Honestly, I don’t even know if this counts as being back. My previous blog post was just about a year ago where I just learned about how to setup and use Hexo. To be completely honest, I actually lost the files for that blog - I had to copy-paste everything from the static website over and regenerate the files from markdown. </p>
<p>In the end, I even removed the second how-to post because it wasn’t really relevant. Part 3 was supposed to be about how to get HTTPS on our own domain with GitHub pages, but now that GitHub has added that functionality… there’s really no point for part 3 either. </p>
<p>So yea, here I am. Essentially with a fresh start. Hopefully I’ll be able to be more consistent this time around with this blog and see where I can go. I’m expecting myself to go pretty ham for the first couple of days or weeks, and eventually slow it down to maybe one post a month.</p>
<h1 id="Why-I’m-Blogging"><a href="#Why-I’m-Blogging" class="headerlink" title="Why I’m Blogging"></a>Why I’m Blogging</h1><p>I’ve been considering about it for a while, and it’s just something I’ve considered since middle school when a relatively close friend, Chelsey, used to blog. I say relatively because I didn’t know her super well back then, but now she’s one of my bestest friends. If you’re reading this Chelsey, thanks &lt;3</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve started blogs up, taken them down, and all that jazz but I’ve never actually dedicated myself to it - or seen the need to. It’s just like that one small project where in the beginning you’re super excited about it, but as time goes on, you realize how truly lazy you are and forget about it. </p>
<p>This time around though, <strong>it might be different</strong>. I’m mainly using this as an outlet as like a diary or a scrapbook, just a lot more messy and uncoordinated. I don’t intend to SEO, monetize, or even promote this blog. I probably won’t even list it in any of my social media profiles - I kinda just ended up on this domain because it’s where my Google account/email is grandfathered. I’ll be sharing <a href="https://kairui.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my portfolio</a> if anyone asks for my ‘website’.</p>
<h1 id="Closing-Statements"><a href="#Closing-Statements" class="headerlink" title="Closing Statements"></a>Closing Statements</h1><p>To close it off for this post, I’m just going to talk about what’s been going on with my life. I guess it’s a lot longer than a closing should be, but I’m edgy like that so let’s kick it off with….</p>
<h2 id="Starting-at-Workday"><a href="#Starting-at-Workday" class="headerlink" title="Starting at Workday"></a>Starting at Workday</h2><p>Today was my first official day as an App Dev intern at WorkDay. I’m currently staying in these apartments about 5 miles away from campus in a single due to insomnia issues. The distance is killer though, my best plan so far is to get a Boosted Board, bus to as close as I can get, and then skateboard the rest of the way. I’ve never skateboarded before, so hopefully this works out. My housemate, Gayashan Ediriweera, is absolutely incredible. He’s super chill and is married. This guy used to be a Senior Consultant at Deloitte and went back to ‘Vandy’ to do his MBA. He even was <a href="https://business.vanderbilt.edu/news/2018/04/25/product-management-workday-internship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured</a> on his university’s website, what a legend. </p>
<p>I honestly feel kind of bad because when I moved in, I picked the Master Bedroom since it was the larger room - then I had to move into the smaller one because G’s got his wife coming over later over the summer. Oops, sorry man.</p>
<p>The intern orientation was honestly about as boring as it gets. We just covered the company’s core values etc. I also ended up with the wrong laptop style - a MacBook Air instead of a MacBook Pro. I feel like coding and running VMs on an Air just gunna result in a lot of headaches, gotta go back in tomorrow to swap it out. I also need to go back home and grab my passport for the I-9 paperwork ughhhhh…</p>
<p>First thing I did when I got into the company Slack was join the <code>#fortnite-br</code>, <code>#overwatch</code>, and <code>#gaming</code> channels. Gamers will be gamers LOL</p>
<h2 id="My-Health-Problems"><a href="#My-Health-Problems" class="headerlink" title="My Health Problems"></a>My Health Problems</h2><p>To be fair, I’m not sure how many of these are real problems and how many of them are just due to my poor lifestyle and life choices. It just sucks because I’m one of those people that get anxiety over it, and my brain just accentuates the pain/discomfort.</p>
<h3 id="Carpal-Tunnel"><a href="#Carpal-Tunnel" class="headerlink" title="Carpal Tunnel"></a>Carpal Tunnel</h3><p>Or at least I think it’s carpal tunnel. My left hand and forearm are just strugglin’ and will have moments where they do feel tinges of numbness. I really do need to wash my brace and start wearing it again at night - I feel like it did help back when I used to wear it.</p>
<h3 id="Anxiety"><a href="#Anxiety" class="headerlink" title="Anxiety"></a>Anxiety</h3><p>Ooooh boy, this is a big one. I started having anxiety sometime back in Oct/Nov of 2017 during school where I fell pretty ill and never truly recovered. I got nausea, dizziness, general body fatigue, and felt like shit all day. I spent many hundreds of dollars and months of my time going to doctors trying to figure out what was wrong. During that time, I fell to the lowest of the lows: depression. I barely made it through, and every day was such a struggle. I went through counseling, physical therapy, and a huge range of rehab until around February 2018. I told myself that I’ve had enough, and would just live my life even if I would be ‘disabled’ for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Starting them, I saw things just get better over time. However, after my birthday trip to Toronto where I got <em>too high</em> off of an edible, I developed severe anxiety again - alongside insomnia among other things. I’m working on it, and really hoping that I’ll make it through again this time around!</p>
<h3 id="Vision"><a href="#Vision" class="headerlink" title="Vision"></a>Vision</h3><p>My vision has degraded at an alarming rate since I stopped wearing night time hard contacts, and I really do need to schedule one last follow-up with UCB Eye Center. God I love those folks.</p>
<h3 id="Dental"><a href="#Dental" class="headerlink" title="Dental"></a>Dental</h3><p>Ok, I’m 99% sure I have a cavity cus when I thought I was dying, hygiene was the last thing on my mind. Going to a dentist tomorrow and I’m absolutely terrified. I also lost my retainer, but I got a new one from a terrific orthodontist. Shit hurts though ugh.</p>
<h3 id="Rash"><a href="#Rash" class="headerlink" title="Rash"></a>Rash</h3><p>Not gunna go into too much details about this one… sucks being hairy -_-</p>
<h2 id="That’s-It"><a href="#That’s-It" class="headerlink" title="That’s It?"></a>That’s It?</h2><p>I think that’s it this time around. I can’t think of any other stuff to rant or talk about. I lied, there’s plenty, like my experience at Microsoft Build, my goals for this summer, Maplestory 2, and probably a billion other more that I just haven’t written down yet. But once again, this blog is more for me to gather my thoughts and relieve some of all that pent of stress, frustration, anxiety, yada-yada. </p>
<p>Hopefully I can keep this up!</p>

It has a large community behind the project is a popular choice for blogs and personal websites hosted on GitHub pages. Unlike Jekyll, a similar generator, Hexo supports plugins in its themes.</p>
<p>Unlike other competitors like Wordpress, Ghost, and Medium, Hexo allows you to easily modify the HTML and Javascript. This flexibility was what prompted me to eventually choose Hexo myself.</p>

<li><p>Login to your Github account and create a new repository by clicking the + button at the top right of the page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Name your repository <code>YourGithubUsername.github.io</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, my Github username is <code>KaitoKid</code> so my username, so my repository is named <code>kaitokid.github.io</code></p>
<p><img src="https://kairuizeng.com/blog/images/hexo-setup/repo_name.png" alt="github repo name"></p>
<h3 id="Deploying-to-git"><a href="#Deploying-to-git" class="headerlink" title="Deploying to git"></a>Deploying to git</h3><p>Before anything, you need to add an SSH key to your GitHub account, otherwise you won’t be able to directly deploy with Hexo. You can simply follow the instructions provided by GitHub:</p>
<ol>
<li>Checking for existing SSH keys</li>
<li>Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent</li>
<li>Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account</li>
</ol>
<p>In case the git deployer for Hexo isn’t already installed, run the following command in your blog root folder</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npm install hexo-deployer-git --save</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Now go back into your <code>_config.yml</code> file and fill in the git property with your new Github pages repository.</p>
<p>The specific segment is as listed below. Make sure to match the indentation.</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># Deployment</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">## Docs: http://hexo.io/docs/deployment.html</span></span><br><span class="line">deploy:</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">type</span>: git</span><br><span class="line">  repo: git@github.com:kaitokid/kaitokid.github.io.git</span><br><span class="line">  branch: master</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Now run the following commands to deploy:</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">hexo clean</span><br><span class="line">hexo deploy --generate</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Congratuations!</p>
<p>You should now be able to see your new blog at <code>YourGithubUsername.github.io</code></p>
